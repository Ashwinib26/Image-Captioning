# üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generation Model  
This project is an **Image Caption Generation Model** that uses deep learning techniques to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. The model combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** or **Transformers** for natural language generation.

---

## üöÄ Features  
- Accepts **images as input** and generates natural language captions.  
- Uses **CNNs** (e.g., ResNet) to extract image features.  
- Incorporates **RNN-based Decoder** (LSTM/GRU) or **Transformers** for caption generation.  
- Can be trained and tested on popular datasets like **Flickr8k, Flickr30k, or MS COCO**.

## üìú How the Model Works  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Image Feature Extraction (Encoder)**  
- A **pretrained CNN** (e.g., ResNet-50 or Inception) is used to extract image features.  
- The model generates a fixed-length feature vector for each image.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Caption Generation (Decoder)**  
- The extracted image features are passed to a **Decoder** model.  
- The Decoder can use:  
  - **RNNs (LSTM/GRU)**: Sequentially generates captions word by word.  
  - **Transformers**: Uses attention mechanisms for better context understanding.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Training the Model**  
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss for caption generation.  
- **Optimization**: Adam Optimizer with learning rate scheduling.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU, CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE.
