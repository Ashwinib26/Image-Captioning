## 🖼️ **Image Caption Generator Using Deep Learning**

---

### 📌 **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that allows users to upload an image and receive a meaningful textual description (caption) generated by an AI model. This project combines the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for visual understanding and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for language generation, offering a practical demonstration of how vision and language models can work together to understand and describe the visual world.

### 💡 **Key Concepts Involved**

1. **Deep Learning**
   - *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* – for image feature extraction.
   - *Sequence Models (RNN)* – for generating captions word-by-word.
   
2. **Transfer Learning**
   - Using **DenseNet201**, a pre-trained model on ImageNet, to extract rich feature representations from uploaded images.

3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Tokenization and padding for handling caption sequences.
   - Using a tokenizer to convert words into sequences and vice versa.
   
4. **Web Development**
   - Built using **Flask** as the backend framework.
   - Frontend styled with HTML and CSS.
   - Upload functionality and dynamic rendering of captions and images.

5. **Model Deployment**
   - Loading a trained model (`caption_model.keras`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`) for inference on unseen images.

### ⚙️ **Methodology**

#### 1. **Model Training (pre-done before integration)**
- **Image Encoder:** A CNN (DenseNet201) model was trained to extract 1024-dimensional feature vectors from each image.
- **Caption Decoder:** An RNN model was trained on sequences of words using features from the encoder as input. The training aimed to predict the next word in the caption given the previous words and image features.
- **Tokenizer:** Fitted on the training captions and saved as a `.pkl` file for reuse during inference.

#### 2. **Image Upload & Feature Extraction**
- Users upload images through a Flask web form.
- The image is saved to a static folder (`/static/uploaded/`).
- DenseNet201 processes the image and extracts a feature vector using average pooling.

#### 3. **Caption Generation**
- The extracted image features and a seed word `"startseq"` are passed to the trained model.
- The model predicts the next word token iteratively until it reaches `"endseq"` or the maximum sequence length.
- The final caption is displayed after removing special tokens.

#### 4. **Frontend and User Interface**
- The frontend is designed with a clean, minimal interface that allows:
  - Uploading an image.
  - Displaying the uploaded image.
  - Displaying the AI-generated caption.

### 📚 **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how image understanding and language modeling can be combined to create intelligent caption-generating systems. It showcases the power of modern deep learning architectures and web development to solve real-world AI challenges. The application bridges the gap between raw visual content and descriptive text, simulating a fundamental form of image comprehension by machines.
